# ServiceBusDemo
Demo App Services Endâ€‘toâ€‘End with Azure Functions and Service Bus (Python)

ðŸ“¦ **Service Bus Sender App (SERVICEBUSQUEUELOAD)**
This folder contains two Python scripts that demonstrate how to send messages to an Azure Service Bus queue.
Itâ€™s meant to be run locally to load test data into the queue that the Function Apps will process.

ðŸ“‚ Files
File	Purpose
send_message.py	Simple synchronous sender using the azure-servicebus library.
load_queue.py	Asynchronous sender using asyncio and passwordless identity (or connection string).
requirements.txt	Python dependencies.
local.settings.json	Local environment configuration (optional).

ðŸ”§ Prerequisites
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

In both examples, set your queue name and connection string (or use passwordless authentication):
CONNECTION_STR
QUEUE_NAME

âœ… **1. send_message.py â€“ Synchronous Example**

Libraries: azure-servicebus

Highlights:
-> Creates a ServiceBusClient using a connection string.
-> Creates a sender for the specified queue.
-> Iterates through a list of messages (Order #1001, Order #1002, etc.) and sends them synchronously.
-> Prints confirmation for each message sent.

ðŸ‘‰ Use case:
Great for quick tests or small batch sends.

âœ… **2. load_queue.py â€“ Asynchronous Example**

Libraries:
azure-servicebus (async support)
asyncio

Highlights:
-> Uses async/await for highâ€‘throughput sending.
-> Can run with passwordless authentication (Managed Identity) or connection strings, as shown in Microsoft docs( https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-python-how-to-use-queues?tabs=passwordless ).
-> Scales better when you need to send a large number of messages quickly.

ðŸ›  Running the Sender App
Synchronous example: python send_message.py
Asynchronous example: python load_queue.py

âœ… Both scripts will print âœ… Sent message: â€¦ and you should see messages arriving in your Service Bus queue.
